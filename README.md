# complete-login-project
An exploration and combination of the following for golang and nodeJS/js/html:
PAM-based login
JWT
sessions
https
non-PAM-based login (via an external RESTful service, e.g. a generic admin api)

Purpose of this project is to combine open source tutorial code into a simple but safe login-authentication-single page style app structure that I can reuse in other projects.
